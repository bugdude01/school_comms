#"school_comms" 

So, as my son heads back to his special needs school we are told that his "Home-School" communication book can no longer be used. This gives us an in formal line of communication to the school so we can tell each other about stuff he has got up to or anything the other party needs to know. 

As the phisical book is no longer an option, I'm adapting a small Django "Blog" with the associated "Comments Feed" to emulate the book. The staff have access to all the students via Django Admin, and the parents have access to only their child / children, keeping data protection at the forefront of the project.

Let's see how it goes!
